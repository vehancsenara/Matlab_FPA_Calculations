The repository contains the files used, but not the data used as requested by the research team. The main file is called Scripted.m, which is used to run all the other files. FPA_kin.m calculates the FPA from the kinematics data, and FPA_forceplate.m from the force plate data. The adap_c.m file computes the adaptive constants, the order_fz pedi sorts the mixed data series into order. The smoothEMG.m file is the RMS algorithm to smooth the EMG signal. These_thing.m is used to model the noise in the data. In addition, wilcoxon.py performs the statistical analysis between pre- and post-FES data.
